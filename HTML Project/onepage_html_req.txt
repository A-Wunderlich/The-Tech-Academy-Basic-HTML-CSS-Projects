You have been given the following rough requirements for the design of a web page:

The page is intended to be an “Account Creation” page for a site that lets people view photos.

The page you will create should have some content that describes the site, and should have a form that allows a person to enter in data needed to create an account for them.

The minimum data they will need in order to create an account is:

1. First and Last name

2. Email address

3. Preference for the type of photos they like to see. The available types are:

a. Space photos

b. Sports photos

c. Wildlife photos

d. Plant photos

This means that your form must contain inputs for this data. You can include other inputs if you wish, but you have to allow for this data at a minimum.
