CSS BEST PRACTICES
Here are some tips for writing and maintaining healthy code that won’t frustrate you or others later down the road.

Use classes and IDs sparingly. Use them only when necessary. Not every HTML element on a page requires a class or id assignment. By needlessly assigning classes and ids, your code can become convoluted and difficult to follow.

Create separate stylesheets for different styling purposes. If a section of your stylesheet is solely for the login page, then it is recommended to create a separate stylesheet for it.

Use the CSS shorthand property names. For example, rather than margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, you can code the shorthand as: margin: 1px 1px 1px 1px;

Keep your code organized and comment thoroughly. This doesn’t mean to comment every little detail, but be sure to elaborate about anything that might be confusing.

Use a code validator. The best is validator.w3.org. (Link below) This is a great way of making sure your code is accurate and will render properly. https://validator.w3.org/
